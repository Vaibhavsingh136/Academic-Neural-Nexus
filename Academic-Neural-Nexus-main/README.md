# Academic Neural Nexus
This is an AI powered Student -> Teacher Feedback as well as education System.

Here the integrated AI system manages all the data necessary for both the teacher and the student's ends.

For the Teacher's end the AI system summarizes all the student's requirements as well as performances. 

It can also help him/her to generating tests, notes to teach their students.

On the student's side it can help them summarize notes or generate pop quizes from the notes provided by their teacher.

There is also a parent mode where a student's parents can access the system to learn about their ward's performance and other aspects. (Coming Soon...)
